# Contributing Guide

**_Thanks for contributing!_**

Here are some docs of how to get started I have put together.

1. First checkout the project from `git` -- or fork if desired.
2. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation). I prefer
   to use `homebrew` for this:
   ```sh
   $ brew install pnpm
   ```
   
3. Add alias for `pnpm` to your `bash` or `zsh` config:
   ```sh
   echo 'alias pn=pnpm' >> ~/.zshenv
   ```

4. Install project dependencies:
   ```sh
   $ pn i
   ```
